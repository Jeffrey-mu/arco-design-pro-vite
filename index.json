  "description": "Do you consider the quality of the air in your house seriously? Although it cannot be seen with the naked eye, poor air quality impacts human health. Signs of invisible airborne particles include stale smells, smokey conditions, or the lingering fragrance of Sunday morning's bacon. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are released by common home items, including furniture, textiles, and certain interior paint materials, and they are typically undetectable to the human nose.",

Here's the <b>Molekule Air Pro</b>, a super-sleek, top-of-the-line air purifier. Advertisements for this company are undoubtedly showing up on various websites and your Instagram feed. When properly installed, this air purifier from the Molekule family can clean the air in a space as big as 100 square feet. The cleaner's spherical form, anodized aluminum coating, and leather-like grip had me eager to clear some floor space for it. Regarding technological aspects, Molekule offers better air filtration owing to its cutting-edge PECO filtration technology, eliminating pollutants rather than trapping them. The convenience of using a mobile app to operate the device was another selling point.</p><p><br></p><p>Those who are like me have heard about the problems with indoor air quality but have put off taking any action to improve it. The unattractive design of most available air purifiers is one reason I've been hesitant to get one.</p><p><br></p><p>The Molekule Air Pro is the newest and best Molekule air purifier you can get yet still not really a productive powerhouse.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Pros:</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>+ Fast and simple assembly.</p><p>+ I was mistaken about the size.</p><p>+ Apparatus Mobil.</p><p>+ A quick and simple reordering.</p><p>+ Sensor.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Cons</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p>- Costly in comparison to alternative air cleaners.</p><p>- Expense Reduction Filtering: ($150/each or $99).</p><p>- The mobile app experiences a little delay.</p><p><br></p><h2><b>Specifications</b><b></b></h2><p><br></p><p><b>Color:</b>  Silver</p><p><b>Item Weight</b><b>:  </b>22.9 Pounds</p><p><b>Brand</b><b>:  </b>Molekule</p><p><b>Power Source</b><b>:  </b>Corded Electric</p><p><b>Floor Area</b><b>:  </b>1000 Square Feet</p><p><b>Noise:</b><b> </b>33 dBa- 65 dBa</p><p><b>Warranty:</b> 2 years</p>",

The Molecule's LCD comes to life after you reinsert the filter, and it can then be connected to your home's wifi network. Here's where the situation started to become tricky. I hoped that by using the Molekule app, I would need the air purifier working in a matter of minutes. My husband and I tried to connect the Air Pro to our wifi network for 45 minutes before giving up in exasperation. We were frustrated by the app's inability to get beyond the matching step. Despite being given the name \"Molly\" by the app, our air purifier did not seem to be able to connect to our wifi.</p><p><br></p><p>We repeated the troubleshooting procedures that night, and after a few more failed attempts, Molly was able to connect to our wifi network. Since then, there have been no more network disruptions. When unpacking, I gave the Air Pro a perfect 10 out of 10, but after experiencing technical issues, my opinion of it dropped dramatically. Due to the high cost of this air purifier, I had hoped for an easy installation process. Unfortunately, technology isn't always straightforward, so I've managed to get past my first annoyance.</p><p><br></p><p>You should know that perhaps the Air Pro initially has a peculiar smell. Although Molekule warns of off-gassing and claims it's normal during the filter's \"break-in\" phase, it's paradoxical that a product meant to eliminate odors would add its unique aroma to the air. As much as I feared that this aroma would become permanent in our home, it ultimately faded away. In no way unpleasant, it was yet a peculiar odor.</p>",

Both the air purifier's fan speed and the purification output may be adjusted manually or automatically, but your primary choices will be between Standard and Quiet modes of operation. By default, the machine has an automatic mode where the fan speed increases when a sensor detects an increase in airborne particles. Since we have no reservations about blindly trusting our equipment to make sound judgments and run automatically, we opted for the automatic mode. We put Molly to work in Standard mode to get a sense of the device's capabilities and to record the<b> volatile organic compounds</b> (VOCs) that were likely being released by our brand-new couch.</p>",

If you want to keep an eye on the air quality in your home but don't want to be inundated with data, the Molekule can assist. To estimate air quality, the Air Pro uses laser technology to quantify particle size in an air sample. Molekule is determined to emphasize that numerous elements contribute to indoor air quality and that the Air Pro isn't designed to be an all-encompassing measure of air quality. You shouldn't rely just on the air quality indicator in your area but rather utilize it as part of a larger evaluation process.</p><p><br></p><p>The air quality may be quickly assessed by looking at the LCD screen, which displays data in a color-coded manner. When you wake up the Air Pro by tapping the screen, you'll see either green, yellow, red, or violet light, corresponding to a good, moderate, bad, or very bad rating. It's become almost reflexive for me to check the air quality in my house. I check the air quality many times a day as I go by Molly by tapping the screen. As soon as I see the green circle, I stop looking because I know it must be nice. Since its inception, days with Moderate and perhaps very bad air quality have been uncommon.</p><p><br></p><p>The Molekule Air Pro may report on three distinct particle sizes: PM 10, PM 2.5, and PM 1.0. Again, the number of particles within each size identified by the Molekule is shown on a sliding scale from \"good\" to \"moderately bad\" to \"extremely terrible,\" providing just a rough estimate. Sometimes, I wish I could inform myself more about the particle count, but I'm not sure why. I suppose I should have expected information overload, given that the market now has a vacuum cleaner that utilizes a laser to detect but counts particulate matter (looking at you, Dyson V15 Detect).</p><p><br></p><p>Particles smaller than 10 microns may be inhaled and lodged in the lungs, which is crucial information. The EPA reports that the biggest health danger comes from particles with a diameter of fewer than 2.5 microns. My ability to make informed judgments regarding my home's air quality has been greatly enhanced by my familiarity with the frequent air detections made by Air Pro. Although I am unable to eliminate or even significantly reduce indoor air pollution, I may reduce its severity by addressing the most prevalent causes, such as poor ventilation or the presence of toxic chemicals. And for the things I can't alter, I take comfort in knowing that Molly is on the lookout for and eliminating airborne contaminants.</p>",

Mold, viruses, germs, and VOCs are all eliminated thanks to the Air Pro's PECO filter's treated layers. This filter's coating interacts with ultraviolet light at the filter's core, destroying contaminants at the molecular level. The filtered air is then vented from the unit's top. According to Molekule, the Air Pro can filter out particles 1,000 times lower than the industry standard for HEPA filters by harnessing free radicals to remove pollutants. However, there are currently no universal filters designed to work further with Molekule Air Pro.</p><p><br></p><p>If somehow a generic PECO filtration is fitted, the Air Pro will not function. When you sign up for Molecule's automatic filter replacement plan, you'll get significant savings from the pre-filter pricing, and you'll have the flexibility to suspend or terminate your plan at any time. The Air Pro's LCD and the accompanying mobile application provide real-time access to the filter's remaining life.</p><p>The PECO filter did not pass muster in my tests. The Air Pro was installed and working well for two days until an error message informing the user that no filter was present. The problem warning stopped appearing after a few hours, and the device kept functioning normally.</p><p><br></p><p>A more ominous-looking mistake with a crimson backdrop came two weeks later. A \"Filter cannot be verified\" error message confirmed my suspicion that the Molekule was not intended to work with standard air filters. I'm relieved that I've found Molecule's technical assistance accessible, kind, and competent. Customer service walked me through reinstalling the filter after describing the problem messages. Though the problem seemed to have been fixed, it returned a week later. When I contacted PECO's technical support again, I got an immediate answer stating that perhaps the filter might have been damaged and that a replacement would be sent to me at no cost, along with a mailing label for the defective one.</p><p><br></p><p>Most annoying further about Molekule Air Pro was the broken filter. The constant error warnings were annoying for such an expensive piece of equipment. But Molekule came through with swift and expert customer service that addressed the issue at no further expense to me. The filter still has 77% of its life left after being used for approximately two months. A filter's lifespan varies depending on the air quality in your home, but Molekule recommends replacing it every six months as a baseline.</p>",

The first reading for my air quality was Very Bad, with elevated levels of all three categories of particulate matter measured by the equipment. Several factors may be at play here, but I blamed a combination of my penchant for scented candles and a brand-new couch built on a plywood frame (plywood is notorious for off-gassing). Approximately two hours later, the air quality was upgraded to \"Moderate.\" We let it run all night, and it had gotten too Good by morning. Once we got through the first adjustment period, we saw a major improvement in our home's air quality, or fragrance aesthetic, which I prefer to call it.</p><p><br></p><p>I was terrified of using the cooktop to prepare fish or add flavor to a meal by sautéing garlic before Molly moved in. Sometimes I worry whether I really can't smell the scents in my own house, while my friends are too nice to tell me. After many weeks of utilizing the<b> Molekule</b>, I've found that my house has a more subtle aroma that doesn't reveal my cooking habits, washing routine, or overflowing garbage can. While I still believe that nothing can replace consistent home cleaning, I have noticed that using an air purifier may assist reduce the lingering presence of some scents.</p>",

We also listened to that same Molekule Air Pro to get a sense of its operating noise level, explored its other features, and rated its user interface as part of our assessment. Only Molekule Air Pro has a PECO filter instead of the more common HEPA filter, making it the first air purifier we've evaluated so far to use a PECO filter.
